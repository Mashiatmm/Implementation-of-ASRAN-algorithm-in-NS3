# Implementation-of-ASRAN-algorithm-in-NS3
CSE 322 - Computer Networking Term Project

This is an implementation of the ASRAN ( Adaptive SSThresh Reviser for Flying Ad Hoc Network ) algorithm as a part of my Computer Networking Course's Term Project.

# Purpose
This algorithm is designed for quickly recovering throughput in a UAV Network. Due to mobility of UAVs, many packets get dropped which is detected as a case of congestion in the network whereas the actual reason is the mobility.
This algorithm identifies the cause of the packet drops and takes necessary steps accordingly.
